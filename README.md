| Unit | Percentage | Hello Series usage |
| ------------- | ----------- | ----------- |
|  Big Idea 1: Creative Computing | 10-13% | Students will build a Web Site Portfolio and Team Project(S) according to their own interests |
|  Big Idea 2: Data | 17-22% | Student will define and establish data definitions in Python. They will use "backend" Python data in "frontend" to be rendered via HTML. |
|  Big Idea 3: Algorithms and Programming | 30-35% | Students will engage in defining Python dictionaries, organizing data, and processing data on HTML pages.  Students will learn HTML makrup, Jinja templates, and Jinja/Python logic |
|  Big Idea 4: Computer Systems and Network | 11-15% | Students by Self Hosting a Web server on a Raspberry Pi will learn about system processes and network protocols (HTTP).  Students will enable Flask, Gunicorn, Nginx processes on a Self-Hosted-Web server.  Students will learn how a system (web server) responds to GET and POST HTTP events.  |
|  Big Idea 5: Impact of Computing | 21-26% |  Students will learn how a Web Server can provide opportunity to share information via N@tM activity.   This Web Server will enable students opportunities for personal information sharing, around the globe. |
